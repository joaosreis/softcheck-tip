# SoftCheck implementation for TIP

![main workflow](https://github.com/joaosreis/softcheck-tip/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

This is an implementation of [SoftCheck](https://github.com/joaosreis/softcheck)
for the [TIP (Tiny Imperative Programming) language](https://cs.au.dk/~amoeller/spa/1-TIP.pdf).

It provides SoftCheck a frontend for the language and also some predefined
analyses (using [these](https://github.com/joaosreis/softcheck-analysis)).
